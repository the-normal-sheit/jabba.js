# **How to use**
i included the data in jabba.js as a seperate file if you want it
```js
window.Jabba.respond(prompt,outputLength); //returns the jabba.js output

//output length is 5 by default, which makes a decent sized chunk of text
```

```js
//"""example"""
console.log(window.Jabba.respond("hello"));
```
